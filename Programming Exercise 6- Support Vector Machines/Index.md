## Objectives:
 - Support Vector Machines
 - Spam Classification
 
The Support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. 

SVMs are considered by many to be the most powerful 'black box' learning algorithm, and by posing a cleverly-chosen optimization objective, one of the most widely used learning algorithms today.
