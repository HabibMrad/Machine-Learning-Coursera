# Machine-Learning-Coursera
Coursera learning-related project about Machine Learning. Created by Standford University.

This repository contains my programming assignments for Andrew Ng's Coursera Class. 

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: 
(i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
(iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 

There were 8 programming exercises for the course covering the following topics:

Exercise 1 - Linear Regression

Exercise 2 - Logistic Regression

Exercise 3 - Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks

Exercise 4 - Neural Networks Learning

Exercise 5 - Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance

Exercise 6 - Support Vector Machines

Exercise 7 - K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis

Exercise 8 - Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems
