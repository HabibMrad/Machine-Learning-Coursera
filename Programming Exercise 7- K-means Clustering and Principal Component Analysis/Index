Objectives:
 - K-means Clustering
 - Principal Component Analysis
 
Unsupervised learning:
While supervised learning algorithms need labeled examples (x,y), unsupervised learning algorithms need only the input (x). 
 - Clusteringâ€” is used for market segmentation, text summarization, among many other applications.
 - Principal Components Analysis- is used to speed up learning algorithms, and is sometimes incredibly useful for visualizing and helping you to understand your data.
 How it can be used for data compression to speed up learning algorithms as well as for visualizations of complex datasets.
